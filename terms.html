        <h1 class="section-heading">PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p>This explains how we collect, store, protect, and share your information, and with whom we share it. Whilst you're enjoying the Cupidity mobile application ("App"), we collect some information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App to share information with other members, including your friends and contacts ("Users"). We may also need to share your information sometimes.</p>
    <p>Cupidity is a global app, and your information will be sent to and used in India regardless of the country you reside in. This Policy explains how we protect your personal data when we transfer it overseas, so please read very carefully!</p>
    <p>
        <span class="font-style1">1. Where This Privacy Policy Applies :</span>  This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Cupidity. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services. Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="font-style1">Data Storage :</span> By using the App, you acknowledge that Cupidity is a global app operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the United States. If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="font-style1">2. Collection Of Information:</span>  When you download the App and create an account ("Account"), we may collect certain information ("Registration Information") about you, such: <br>

•Mobile number<br>
•Gender identity<br>
•Age<br>

        If you contact our Customer Support team, we will receive your email address, and may track your IP address as well as the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from you about other Users (and from other Users about you).<br>
        We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself.

Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile.<br>
        Please remember that photographs that you post on Cupidity may reveal information about yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, including through adding certain Badges to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of your information and making this public to other users.<br>
        When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</p>

Data Storage :</span> By using the App, you acknowledge that Cupidity is a global app operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the United States.

                            We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes. In practice, we delete or anonymise your information upon deletion of your account.</p>

                            <p><span class="font-style2">•Device permissions:</span> Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</p>
                            <p><span class="font-style2">•Deletion:</span> You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</p>
                            <p class="font-style1">We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</p>
                            <p><span class="font-style2">•Reviewing your information:</span> Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request.</p>
                            <p><span class="font-style2">•Updating your information:</span> If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us.<br>
                                For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>
                                <p>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-style2">•Uninstall :</span> You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-style2">•Accountability:</span>In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-style1">8. Our Policy Towards Age :</span> Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.</p>
                                <p><span class="font-style1">9. How We Protect Your Information :</span> We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.<br>
                                    We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.<br>
                                    We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately.</p>
                                    <p><span class="font-style1">10. How Long We Retain Your Information :</span> There is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or<br>
                                        The information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.<br>
                                        Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.</p>
                                        <p><span class="font-style1">11. Privacy Policy Changes :</span> Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. The most recent version will be put up on “Privacy Policy” in settings page. If you continue to use the service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
                                        <p><span class="font-style1">12. Third Party Accounts :</span> If you have registered with Cupidity using a third party social media platform, such as Facebook, your Cupidity profile will be available to all Users of Cupidity whether via our App or our partners' websites.<br>
                                            Remember that when you register with a third party, you are also giving them personal information, so we recommend that you read their privacy policies as Cupidity does not control how they use their information.<br>
                                            If you have registered on one of these third party websites, such as Facebook, or you have verified your Account via a third party website, we may connect your Cupidity profile with your profile on such website. We may do this by way of new products and applications which we introduce from time to time, including new products powered by our group companies.<br>
                                            If you have created a Cupidity profile through a third party website and you do not want to link your Cupidity profile to your profile on the third party website, Cupidity cannot amend these settings. Please visit the application settings on your third party website profile and follow the instructions to remove the Cupidity access permissions.<br>
                                            We only use the APIs, OAuth Tokens, Widgets, or other means provided by the applicable Social Media Account to integrate your Social Media Account with our App. As such, we only receive the limited information that each Social Media Account permits to be transferred.</p>

                                            <p><span class="font-style1">13. Residents of California :</span> If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.

For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request.</p>
